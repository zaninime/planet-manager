# Contributing
We love pull requests from everyone! We don’t feature a full “code of conduct” document, but please be polite and don’t harass or offend anybody.

## How to start
*Read the docs!* The `README.md` contains everything necessary to start developing on this project. If not, please file an issue!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Make sure the linter is okay and tests are passing (`npm run lint` and `npm run test`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run the linter and the tests again, make them pass
5. Open a Pull Request and write a good headline + description of what you have done, it’s going to be used as the commit message
6. Sign the CLA as requested by our bot

At this point, you’re waiting for us. We will review your PR as soon as possible, usually a couple of business days.

## Best practices and standards
